Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).[4] World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.[5] In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes,[6] making it the second most-produced cereal after maize.[6][7] Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century.[8] Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.
